# A Himitsu Landing page

This is a small website I made for my music project, [A Himitsu](https://soundcloud.com/a-himitsu), mainly in order to collect all various links to online music stores and downloads in one place.

The main point of the site is to be able to share links to my tracks for my listeners where a bunch of relevant links are available (such as Spotify, iTunes, Free download- links)

It's written in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) using [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). I used the [HashRouter](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/HashRouter) in order to make the client-side routing work for Github Pages [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#notes-on-client-side-routing](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#notes-on-client-side-routing).
