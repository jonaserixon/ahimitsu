# A Himitsu Landing page

This is a small website I made for my music project, [A Himitsu](https://soundcloud.com/a-himitsu), mainly in order to collect all various links to online music stores and downloads in one place.

The main point of the site is to be able to share a link to a specific track of mine that has a bunch of relevant links.
